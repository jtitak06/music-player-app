**My Process**
This project is a music player application build on React. The first step of this project was to build the HTML and CSS. Since I was unfamiliar with how to create audio and other aspects of this project in React, I used most of the styling features from a YouTube tutorial video.

After the HTML and CSS was complete, I then coded the application. The first step was to import useState, useRef, and useEffect from React. Then, I proceeded to install font-awesome to be able to have the icons on the buttons. Different features were coded in two js files with the functionality components imported to the Player.js file. Player.js was then exported to the App.js file and App.js was exported to the index.js file.

Each Javascript file serves a different purpose for this project. The PlayerControls.js file dictates the functionality of the application. Specifically the the play and skip buttons. The PlayerDetails.js file changes the display of the current song and next song. The Player.js file makes the functional components work with the useState, useEffect, and useRef features from React.

The songs in this music player are Afrobeats songs that were popular at the time of creation.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
